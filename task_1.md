#1 I think it is better to involve the owner throughout the process, to show them how each piece works and show how it meets the client's standards, and if they are satisfied, this way you can correct as you go, and whittle it down into bite sized pieces for someone who may not be as skilled at code.

#2 Yes, absolutely. An MVP could be a five minute alpha of the game, with all the options available that are success criteria, showing off the bare minimum, while not giving off too much content. Then next time it could be a ten minute beta where there are some story elements, continuing until you build the full game meeting the client's expectations. I expect to get info about specific things the client wants, say a more interesting story, or a streamlined method of saving or checking inventory, and improving on that for the next prototype, where the client will use the same process again.

#3 They both implement the use of generating a basic, but complete idea, and presenting it to a person, who gives feedback. For example, the flat plate on the door. It is the bare minimum, but it generates thought in whoever is using it on how it could be better made

4# discoverability and feedback. Discovery is when a person figures out how an item works, and then hopes to receive feedback, which tells them if what their doing is right or wrong. You create something that allows for this by observing what a person needs and how they interact with things, coming up with a solution through idea-making, create a prototype for the person to try, and then take their feedback and run it back through the cycle.

#5 I can improve players experience by:

-Testing out systems that I invent to solve the problem of saves and progression with a user, seeing what is outdated and archaic and improving on those tactics while moving throughout the game

-Creating points of the story based on my writing and allowing the player to suggest edits and write ups to make plot more interesting

-allowing the player to use their creativity in an attempt to break my code and then using their feedback on how it was done to fix these issues.
